# Plan: Update Auditor Task Files to Reference Canonical Reference Docs

**Issue:** `.opencode#2211`
**Spec:** `.opencode/.issues/2211/spec.md`
**Dependency:** `.opencode#2210` — must complete first (creates reference docs)

## Goal / Architecture / Files / Dispatch

**Goal:** Update the four auditor task files to read from canonical reference docs (`reference/spec-structure-standards.md`, `reference/plan-structure-standards.md`, `reference/cost-model-standards.md`) via `Read [Text](path)` instead of hard-coding structural criteria. Remove criteria eliminated during brainstorming.

**Architecture:** The auditor task files currently hard-code their own separate criteria lists that duplicate — and have drifted from — the producer templates. The fix replaces hard-coded criteria with `Read [Text](path)` references to canonical reference docs created by `.opencode#2210`. Criteria that are cross-artifact comparisons or behavioral judgments remain as explicit instructions.

**Files:**
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md` — update Step 5a, Steps 5b-5h, SC-13
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-investigator.md` — update Step 3
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/plan-fidelity-evaluator.md` — update Step 3, PF-7a
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/plan-fidelity-investigator.md` — update Steps 2-5

**Dispatch:** `audit` (modify task files), `verification` (verify reference doc paths), `test-driven-development` (RED/GREEN cycles), `verification-before-completion` (verify SCs), `finishing-a-development-branch` (checklist), `git-workflow` (review-prep), `pr-creation-workflow` (create PR), `completion-core` (lifecycle event)

## Blast Radius

- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md` — Step 5a (SC table), Steps 5b-5h (individual SC checks), SC-13 (cost-frame)
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-investigator.md` — Step 3 (spec structure evidence collection)
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/plan-fidelity-evaluator.md` — Step 3 (PF criteria), PF-7a (cost-frame)
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/plan-fidelity-investigator.md` — Steps 2-5 (evidence collection items)
- `reference/spec-structure-standards.md` — read-only dependency (created by `.opencode#2210`)
- `reference/plan-structure-standards.md` — read-only dependency (created by `.opencode#2210`)
- `reference/cost-model-standards.md` — read-only dependency (created by `.opencode#2210`)

> **Compliance:** All SCs must pass before completion. Partial implementation is not permitted. Each item is daisy-chained — item N's commit is precondition for item N+1's RED.

> **One step at a time.** Execute exactly one step. Report progress. Wait for instruction before the next step.

> **Step status:** Report `[item N] [PASS|FAIL]` after each step. If FAIL, report blocker and halt.

> **Enforcement gate:** All SCs must pass before this plan is complete.

## Phase Table

| Phase | Name | Concern | SCs | Dependencies | Steps | Dispatch |
|-------|------|---------|-----|-------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Update spec-audit-evaluator.md | spec-audit-evaluator-update | SC-1 | `.opencode#2210` | 1-4 | audit |
| 2 | Update spec-audit-investigator.md | spec-audit-investigator-update | SC-2 | Phase 1 | 5-8 | audit |
| 3 | Update plan-fidelity-evaluator.md | plan-fidelity-evaluator-update | SC-3 | Phase 2 | 9-12 | audit |
| 4 | Update plan-fidelity-investigator.md | plan-fidelity-investigator-update | SC-4 | Phase 3 | 13-16 | audit |
| 5 | Verify reference doc paths | reference-doc-verification | SC-5 | `.opencode#2210` | 17-20 | verification |
| 6 | Update spec-audit-evaluator.md SC-13 cost-frame | spec-audit-evaluator-cost-frame | SC-6 | Phase 5 | 21-24 | audit |
| 7 | Update plan-fidelity-evaluator.md PF-7a cost-frame | plan-fidelity-evaluator-cost-frame | SC-7 | Phase 6 | 25-28 | audit |

> **Self-Remediation Protocol:** If a step FAILs: diagnose root cause, fix the deliverable, re-verify. If the fix requires spec revision, update the spec and re-enter the plan. Escalate only after remediation failure.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] C1: All 7 phases complete with PASS
- [ ] C2: All 4 auditor task files updated to reference canonical reference docs
- [ ] C3: Eliminated criteria removed from all 4 task files
- [ ] C4: All `Read [Text](path)` references point to existing files
- [ ] C5: Behavioral enforcement tests pass for all modified task files
- [ ] C6: All SCs verified via verification-before-completion
- [ ] C7: Audit confirms plan executed faithfully against spec
- [ ] C8: Cross-validation confirms audit and verification agree
- [ ] C9: PR created with all changes

## Pre-Implementation Steps

- [ ] **Coherence gate.** Verify spec/plan coherence before RED routing. Read the spec at `.opencode/.issues/2211/spec.md` and confirm the plan matches the spec's phase structure, SC assignments, and dependency ordering. If any mismatch is found, return BLOCKED with `COHERENCE_FAIL`.
  - (**inline**)

- [ ] **Baseline check.** Verify the current state of all affected files before modification. Read each file listed in the blast radius and confirm the content matches the "before" state described in the spec. If any file has already been modified, return BLOCKED with `BASELINE_CHANGED`.

## Phase 1 — Update spec-audit-evaluator.md

**Concern:** spec-audit-evaluator-update
**Files:** `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md`
**SCs:** SC-1
**Dependencies:** `.opencode#2210` (reference docs must exist)
**Entry:** Coherence gate and baseline check passed
**Exit:** spec-audit-evaluator.md Step 5a and Steps 5b-5h updated to reference spec-structure-standards

### Code Path Coverage

- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md` Step 5a — SC-1 through SC-14 table
- `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md` Steps 5b-5h — individual SC checks

### Cross-Cutting SCs

None — SC-1 is phase-specific.

### Interface Boundaries

- `reference/spec-structure-standards.md` — read-only dependency, must exist
- No changes to other auditor task files

### State Transitions

- Before: spec-audit-evaluator.md hard-codes SC-1 through SC-14 table
- After: spec-audit-evaluator.md reads from reference/spec-structure-standards.md via `Read [Text](path)`

### Item 1 — Update spec-audit-evaluator.md Step 5a and Steps 5b-5h

- [ ] **RED.** Write a behavioral enforcement test that sends a prompt to the agent and verifies the evaluator reads from `reference/spec-structure-standards.md` instead of hard-coding the SC table. The test MUST fail at this point because the change hasn't been made yet.
  - (**clean-room**) `task(..., prompt: "execute red from test-driven-development. Read \`test-driven-development/tasks/red.md\` first")`

- [ ] **GREEN.** Modify `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md`:
  - Step 5a: Remove the hard-coded SC-1 through SC-14 table. Replace with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md). For each required section in the reference doc, check that the spec has that section with the correct content. For each SC in the spec's SC table, verify it has a verification method, that dependencies are documented, and that SCs are deterministic.`
  - Removed SCs: SC-3 (phases), SC-4 (steps), SC-6 (concerns), SC-7 (fidelity), SC-8 (edge cases), SC-10 (prose structure), SC-13 (cost-frame)
  - Derived from reference doc: SC-1 (preamble), SC-2 (verification methods), SC-5 (dependencies), SC-9 (determinism), SC-11 (documentation sources), SC-12 (preamble fields), SC-14 (enforcement gate)
  - Step 5b (SC-DET): Remains as explicit instruction
  - Step 5c (SC-STRUCTURAL-FAIL): Remains as explicit instruction
  - Step 5d (SC-EVIDENCE-TYPE): Replace hard-coded taxonomy with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md) §Evidence Type Taxonomy and verify each SC's evidence matches the minimum acceptable method.`
  - Step 5e (SC-TRACKING-LANG): Replace hard-coded list with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md) §Prohibited Content Patterns and verify the spec contains no tracking/status language.`
  - Step 5f (SC-PRESCRIPTIVE-CODE): Replace hard-coded rules with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md) §Prohibited Content Patterns and verify the spec contains no prescriptive code.`
  - Step 5g (SC-PIPELINE-GATES): Replace hard-coded rules with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md) §Format Requirements and verify pipeline gates use the canonical checklist format.`
  - Step 5h (SC-CANONICAL-PLAN-FORM): Replace hard-coded rules with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md) §Format Requirements and verify any plan output format requirements use the canonical checklist format.`
  - (**clean-room**) `task(..., prompt: "execute green from test-driven-development. Read \`test-driven-development/tasks/green.md\` first")`

- [ ] **Verify.** Run the RED test again — it MUST pass now. Verify the changes match the spec's SC-1 requirements: grep for SC-1 through SC-14 table removed; grep for Read reference present; grep for removed SC IDs absent.
  - (**clean-room**) `task(..., prompt: "execute verify from verification-before-completion. Read \`verification-before-completion/tasks/verify.md\` first")`

- [ ] **Commit.** Stage and commit the changes to `spec-audit-evaluator.md` with a descriptive message.
  - (**inline**) `git add .opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-evaluator.md && git commit -m "Phase 1: Update spec-audit-evaluator.md to reference spec-structure-standards"`

### Phase Completion

- [ ] VbC: Verify SC-1 — grep for SC-1 through SC-14 table removed; grep for Read reference present; grep for removed SC IDs absent
- [ ] Concern transition: Complete. Proceed to Phase 2 (spec-audit-investigator.md).

### Cross-Cutting SCs

None — SC-2 is phase-specific.

### Interface Boundaries

- `reference/spec-structure-standards.md` — read-only dependency, must exist
- No changes to other auditor task files

### State Transitions

- Before: spec-audit-investigator.md hard-codes section names (Intent and Executive Summary, Documentation Sources, STATUS marker)

### Item 2 — Update spec-audit-investigator.md Step 3

- [ ] **RED.** Write a behavioral enforcement test that verifies the investigator reads from `reference/spec-structure-standards.md` instead of hard-coding section names. The test MUST fail at this point.
  - (**clean-room**) `task(..., prompt: "execute red from test-driven-development. Read \`test-driven-development/tasks/red.md\` first")`

- [ ] **GREEN.** Modify `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/spec-audit-investigator.md`:
  - Remove Step 3.3 (Phase inventory) — phases are a plan concept
  - Remove Step 3.7 (STATUS marker) — prohibited pattern
  - Replace Step 3.5 (Preamble presence) with: `Read [spec-structure-standards.md](reference/spec-structure-standards.md). For each required section in the reference doc, collect evidence about its presence, content, and structure. Record what is found — do not infer or assume.`
  - Remove Step 3.6 (Documentation Sources) as a hard-coded section name — now derived from reference doc
  - Update the `spec_structure` YAML evidence structure to remove `phases`, `preamble`, `documentation_sources`, and `status_marker` fields. Replace with a dynamic structure derived from the reference doc's required sections.
  - (**clean-room**) `task(..., prompt: "execute green from test-driven-development. Read \`test-driven-development/tasks/green.md\` first")`

- [ ] **GREEN.** Modify `.opencode/skills/audit/tasks/plan-fidelity-evaluator.md`:
  - Remove PF-4 (edge cases) — error recovery is a pipeline invariant
  - Remove PF-DELEGATION — too rare, false FAILs
  - Remove PF-GLOBAL-NUMBERING — no evidence of defect prevention
  - Replace PF-6, PF-7, PF-7a, PF-ADMONISHMENT, PF-ONE-STEP, PF-PRESCRIPTIVE-CODE with: `Read [plan-structure-standards.md](reference/plan-structure-standards.md). For each structural element in the reference doc, verify the plan has that element with the correct format.`
