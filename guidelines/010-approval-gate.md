## Tier 0: Zero Tolerance Rules

**These rules are inviolable. Violation is a protocol breach.**

### Mandatory Requirements

| Requirement | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| **Spec before code** | NO code/guideline changes WITHOUT approved spec |
| **Authorization required** | NO implementation WITHOUT explicit `"approved"` or `"go"` |
| **Explicit auth overrides label** | When user says `approved`/`go`, proceed REGARDLESS of `needs-approval` label |
| **Branch first** | Create feature branch BEFORE any file modification |
| **Human-only merge** | Agents MUST NEVER merge PRs |
| **MCP tools** | Use PyCharm/GitHub MCP for file operations when available |
| **Silent halt** | HALT after completion, after PR creation — no prompts |
| **PR timing** | PRs require explicit `"create a PR"` instruction |
| **Issue closure** | Close issues ONLY after PR merge confirmed |

### Explicit Authorization Priority (Critical)

**⚠️ When user provides explicit authorization (`approved`, `go`, `#123 approved`), proceed with implementation even if the `needs-approval` label is present.**

The `needs-approval` label is a **tracking tool**, not a permanent gate. Its purpose is:
- Indicate "awaiting approval" visually
- Remind reviewers that approval hasn't been given yet
- Block agents from proceeding **until** explicit authorization is received

**The label does NOT override explicit user authorization.**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| User says `approved` AND label present | ✅ **PROCEED** - explicit auth wins |
| User says `#123 approved` AND label present | ✅ **PROCEED** - explicit auth wins |
| User says `go` AND label present | ✅ **PROCEED** - explicit auth wins |
| NO user authorization AND label present | ⛔ **HALT** - wait for authorization |
| Label removed by user | ✅ **Proceed if authorized** - no issue |

### Authorization Scope

- **Issue-bound**: Authorization applies ONLY to the specific issue where it was given
- **Session-bound**: New session = new authorization required (no carryover from previous sessions)
- **Single-use**: Authorization for current phase/task only within that issue
- **External input invalidates**: Bug reports require re-authorization
- **Revision ≠ implementation**: Spec updates don't authorize code changes

**🚫 CRITICAL: Old authorizations do NOT apply:**
- "Approved #332" in previous session → NOT VALID for new session
- Previous session authorization → NOT VALID for new issue/spec
- Authorization is ZERO-BASED — every task needs NEW authorization

### Revision Revokes Approval (MANDATORY)

**Any modification to a spec or task document MUST immediately revoke approval.**

When a spec is modified:
1. **Status transitions to pending**: `STATUS: X.Y` → `STATUS: X.Y (REVISED - NEEDS APPROVAL)`
2. **Label applied**: Add `needs-approval` label to the issue
3. **Agent MUST HALT**: Do NOT proceed with implementation
4. **Fresh authorization required**: New explicit approval needed before implementation

**Note**: When using `revise` command, the agent MAY post comments explaining changes but MUST NOT proceed with implementation. `revise` commands allow only documentation updates, never code changes.

**This applies to:**
- Any modification to the spec body (requirements, steps, criteria)
- Any modification to task steps or acceptance criteria
- Typo fixes in spec content (use GitHub comments for clarifications instead)
- Minor clarifications that affect interpretation

**Exempt from approval revocation:**
- STATUS marker updates (`☐ → ☑`, `1.1 → 1.2`)
- Progress comments added to issue
- Bug report additions (separate from spec content changes)

### Label Handling

**The `needs-approval` label is informational when explicit authorization is present.**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| User authorizes AND label present | Proceed with implementation. Label is informational, not blocking. |
| User authorizes AND no label | Proceed with implementation. |
| No authorization AND label present | HALT and wait for explicit authorization. |
| No authorization AND no label | Check for other blockers; proceed if clear. |

**Workflow:**
1. **Explicit authorization received** → Proceed (label status is informational)
2. **No explicit authorization** → Check for `needs-approval` label
3. **Label present without authorization** → HALT and wait for user to authorize

### Bug Report Response

When bug report requires code changes:

1. Add `needs-approval` label
2. Post additional spec comment
3. HALT immediately
4. Wait for explicit `go` or `approved`
