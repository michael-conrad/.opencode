# Git Protocol: Merge Protocol

## Branch Hierarchy

| Branch | Purpose | Merge Strategy |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `main` | Production (Streamlit Cloud) | Merge commit from `dev` only |
| `dev` | Integration testing | Squash merge from `feature/*` |
| `feature/*` | Development work | Created from `dev` |

## Hotfix Workflow (from main)

**For urgent production fixes that need to go directly to production before dev:**

### Branch from main (EXCEPTION to normal workflow)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
```

**This is the ONLY time branches are created from main instead of dev.**

### After hotfix merge to main

Sync the fix to dev:

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge main
git push origin dev
```

## 5. Spec Implementation Branches

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

When implementing an approved spec:

1. **Branch Naming**: Derive from spec filename or issue — `feature/<short-name>` (e.g., Issue #15 → `feature/git-workflow-restructure`)

2. **Branch Creation**: Before any implementation, create and checkout the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/<short-name>
   ```

3. **Work in Isolation**: All implementation commits go on the feature branch, never on `dev` or `main`

4. **Easy Rollback**: If implementation fails, simply `git checkout dev && git branch -D feature/<short-name>`

### 📋 Feature PR Workflow (feature → dev)

**When GitHub MCP Tools Available:**

**Before creating PR:**
1. **Rebase on dev**: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/dev`
2. **Squash commits**: Combine all commits into one: `git reset --soft origin/dev && git commit`
3. **Force push**: `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`
4. **Then create PR**: Target `dev` branch, not `main`

**PR Workflow Steps:**
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-123-description`
2. Commit changes to feature branch
3. Push to remote: `git push origin feature/issue-123-description`
4. Create PR targeting `dev`: `github_create_pull_request` with base `dev`
5. Request review: `github_request_copilot_review`
6. Address feedback with new commits
7. **WAIT for human to merge** — NEVER call `github_merge_pull_request` yourself
8. Delete branch after human merges

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: SQUASH MERGE to dev

**All feature PRs MUST be squash-merged to `dev`.**

- One commit per PR on `dev`
- Each PR is identifiable for cherry-picking
- Clean history for integration testing

**For humans merging feature PRs:**
- GitHub "Squash and merge" button is required
- Target branch: `dev`
- Never merge directly to `main`

---

## Release PR Workflow (dev → main)

**When ready to release to production:**

1. **Create release PR from dev to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3  # or just use dev directly
   ```

2. **PR targets `main`:**
   - Base: `main`
   - Head: `dev` (or release branch)

3. **Merge commit (NOT squash):**
   - Preserves all feature PR commits on `main`
   - Each feature PR remains as separate commit
   - Enables cherry-picking from `main`
   - Maintains `git blame` traceability

**For humans merging release PRs:**
- Use "Merge commit" button (NOT "Squash and merge")
- This preserves PR boundaries on `main`

---

## Hotfix Workflow (from main)

**For urgent production fixes:**

1. **Branch from main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
   ```

2. **Make fix and create PR:**
   - Target `main` for the fix
   - After merge to `main`, also merge to `dev`

3. **Sync back to dev:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git merge main  # or create PR from main to dev
   ```

## Hotfix Backport: Dev as Authoritative Source

**When merging `main` → `dev` after hotfix:**

**CRITICAL: `dev` is authoritative for ALL files except hotfix-specific code.**

### Conflict Resolution Priority

| File Type | Correct Source | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Hotfix-specific files | `main` | Hotfix fix location |
| All other files | `dev` | Dev is authoritative |
| `uv.lock` | `dev` | Dependency state authoritative in dev |
| `.opencode/*` | `dev` | Active development, dev authoritative |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | `dev` | Dev changelog format changes |
| Config files | `dev` | Dev configuration state |

### Hotfix-Specific File Identification

Files are considered hotfix-specific if they were modified in the hotfix PR:

```bash
# Identify hotfix files from PR
gh pr view <hotfix-pr-number> --json files --jq '.files[].path'

# Or from merge commit
git diff <hotfix-branch>^..<hotfix-branch> --name-only
```

**Hotfix-specific files MUST be limited to:**
- Files directly affected by the hotfix fix
- Files required for the fix to work
- NOT configuration, dependencies, or unrelated files

### Conflict Resolution Matrix

**When `git merge main` produces conflicts during hotfix backport:**

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|--------------|------------|
| Hotfix-specific file changed | Take `main` version (hotfix fix) |
| Non-hotfix file changed | Take `dev` version (authoritative) |
| Both changed hotfix file | Manual resolution required |
| Unrelated file changed | Take `dev` version |

**Manual resolution process:**

1. Identify hotfix-specific files from PR diff
2. For each conflicting file:
   - If in hotfix list → take `main` (hotfix)
   - If NOT in hotfix list → take `dev` (authoritative)
3. Complete merge with resolved conflicts

### Example: `uv.lock` Conflict

**Problem:** Hotfix PR updated `uv.lock` in `main`, but `dev` has newer dependencies.

**Resolution:** Take `dev` version of `uv.lock` because:
- `dev` is the authoritative source for dependency state
- Hotfix changes should be code-only, not dependency changes
- If hotfix truly requires dependency update, that's a broader hotfix scope

**Command:**
```bash
git checkout --theirs uv.lock  # Take dev version
git add uv.lock
```

### MANDATORY AI Agent Assistance

**ALL merge conflicts MUST be resolved by AI agent intelligence.**

**Unguided automatic conflict resolution is PROHIBITED.**

Conflict resolution requires understanding:
- Which files are hotfix-specific vs dev-authoritative
- Semantic meaning of conflicting changes
- Impact of each resolution choice
- Potential for data loss or regression

**AI Agent Responsibilities:**

1. **Identify conflict source**: Determine which files changed in hotfix PR
2. **Classify each conflict**: Hotfix-specific vs dev-authoritative
3. **Apply resolution matrix**: Choose correct source for each file
4. **Validate result**: Ensure no unintended data loss
5. **Explain reasoning**: Document why each resolution choice was made

**Workflow:**

When `git merge main` (or any merge) produces conflicts during hotfix backport:

1. AI agent parses the conflict set
2. AI agent identifies hotfix-specific files from PR diff
3. AI agent applies conflict resolution matrix for each file
4. AI agent validates resolution choices
5. AI agent completes merge with resolved conflicts
6. AI agent reports resolution reasoning to user

**⚠️ CRITICAL: No pre-built scripts or automation that bypasses AI intelligence.**

Scripts like `scripts/hotfix_backport.py` that apply resolutions without AI decision-making are PROHIBITED. The AI agent must make informed decisions for EACH conflict.

## When GitHub MCP Tools Unavailable

**Use local squash-merge:**

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

**When merging a feature branch into dev:**
- Use **squash-merge** to create a single clean commit
- Delete the feature branch after merge
- Include spec reference in commit message

**When merging dev into main:**
- Use **merge commit** to preserve PR history
- All feature PRs become separate commits on `main`

**When keeping a feature branch up-to-date:**
- Use **rebase** (not merge) to pull latest changes from `dev`
- `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/dev`

### 🚫 NEVER DO
- **NEVER use regular merge** (`git merge`) to merge feature branches into `dev` — creates messy history
- **NEVER use merge** to sync feature branch with `dev` — use rebase instead
- **NEVER force-push to `main` or `dev`**
- **NEVER squash merge from `dev` to `main`** — loses PR granularity

### Rebase Workflow

```bash
# On feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev

# If conflicts occur, resolve them and continue
git status  # see which files conflict
# edit conflicting files
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```
