# Git Protocol: Merge Protocol

## Branch Hierarchy

| Branch | Purpose | Merge Strategy |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `main` | Production (Streamlit Cloud) | Merge commit from `dev` only |
| `dev` | Integration testing | Squash merge from `feature/*` |
| `feature/*` | Development work | Created from `dev` |

## Hotfix Workflow (from main)

**For urgent production fixes that need to go directly to production before dev:**

### Branch from main (EXCEPTION to normal workflow)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
```

**This is the ONLY time branches are created from main instead of dev.**

### After hotfix merge to main

Sync the fix to dev:

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge main
git push origin dev
```

## 5. Spec Implementation Branches

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

When implementing an approved spec:

1. **Branch Naming**: Derive from spec filename or issue — `feature/<short-name>` (e.g., Issue #15 → `feature/git-workflow-restructure`)

2. **Branch Creation**: Before any implementation, create and checkout the branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/<short-name>
   ```

3. **Work in Isolation**: All implementation commits go on the feature branch, never on `dev` or `main`

4. **Easy Rollback**: If implementation fails, simply `git checkout dev && git branch -D feature/<short-name>`

### 📋 Feature PR Workflow (feature → dev)

**When GitHub MCP Tools Available:**

**Before creating PR:**
1. **Rebase on dev**: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/dev`
2. **Squash commits**: Combine all commits into one: `git reset --soft origin/dev && git commit`
3. **Force push**: `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch>`
4. **Then create PR**: Target `dev` branch, not `main`

**PR Workflow Steps:**
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/issue-123-description`
2. Commit changes to feature branch
3. Push to remote: `git push origin feature/issue-123-description`
4. Create PR targeting `dev`: `github_create_pull_request` with base `dev`
5. Request review: `github_request_copilot_review`
6. Address feedback with new commits
7. **WAIT for human to merge** — NEVER call `github_merge_pull_request` yourself
8. Delete branch after human merges

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: SQUASH MERGE to dev

**All feature PRs MUST be squash-merged to `dev`.**

- One commit per PR on `dev`
- Each PR is identifiable for cherry-picking
- Clean history for integration testing

**For humans merging feature PRs:**
- GitHub "Squash and merge" button is required
- Target branch: `dev`
- Never merge directly to `main`

---

## Release PR Workflow (dev → main)

**When ready to release to production:**

1. **Create release PR from dev to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b release/v1.2.3  # or just use dev directly
   ```

2. **PR targets `main`:**
   - Base: `main`
   - Head: `dev` (or release branch)

3. **Merge commit (NOT squash):**
   - Preserves all feature PR commits on `main`
   - Each feature PR remains as separate commit
   - Enables cherry-picking from `main`
   - Maintains `git blame` traceability

**For humans merging release PRs:**
- Use "Merge commit" button (NOT "Squash and merge")
- This preserves PR boundaries on `main`

## Hotfix Workflow (from main)

**For urgent production fixes:**

1. **Branch from main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix
   ```

2. **Make fix and create PR:**
   - Target `main` for the fix
   - After merge to `main`, also merge to `dev`

3. **Sync back to dev:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git merge main  # or create PR from main to dev
   ```

## When GitHub MCP Tools Unavailable

**Use local squash-merge:**

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

**When merging a feature branch into dev:**
- Use **squash-merge** to create a single clean commit
- Delete the feature branch after merge
- Include spec reference in commit message

**When merging dev into main:**
- Use **merge commit** to preserve PR history
- All feature PRs become separate commits on `main`

**When keeping a feature branch up-to-date:**
- Use **rebase** (not merge) to pull latest changes from `dev`
- `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/dev`

### 🚫 NEVER DO
- **NEVER use regular merge** (`git merge`) to merge feature branches into `dev` — creates messy history
- **NEVER use merge** to sync feature branch with `dev` — use rebase instead
- **NEVER force-push to `main` or `dev`**
- **NEVER squash merge from `dev` to `main`** — loses PR granularity

### Rebase Workflow

```bash
# On feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/dev

# If conflicts occur, resolve them and continue
git status  # see which files conflict
# edit conflicting files
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```
