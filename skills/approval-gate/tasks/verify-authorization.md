# Task: verify-authorization

## Purpose

Check for explicit authorization and needs-approval label status before implementation.

## Entry Criteria

- User says "approved", "go", or similar authorization
- Spec exists as GitHub Issue

## Exit Criteria

- Authorization verified as explicit and for correct issue
- needs-approval label status checked
- Git state verified (worktree environment ready)
- Authorization recorded for scope tracking

## Procedure

### Step 1: Verify Git State (MANDATORY FIRST)

**🚫 CRITICAL: This check MUST happen BEFORE any other work.**

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status
```

**If on `main` or `dev`:** This is expected — feature branches are created in worktrees, not by switching branches in the main tree. Proceed to Step 2.

**If on a feature branch already:** Verify you're in the correct worktree. Check `WORKTREE_PATH` environment variable.

**🚫 CRITICAL: Do NOT create branches directly in verify-authorization.**

Branch creation is DELEGATED to `git-workflow --task pre-work`, which creates worktrees via the `using-git-worktrees` skill. Creating branches here bypasses worktree isolation — a CRITICAL VIOLATION.

**After git state verification:**
1. Record that git state is verified
2. Proceed to Step 2 (authorization verification)
3. After ALL verification steps, invoke `git-workflow --task pre-work` for worktree creation
4. `pre-work` will handle: sync with `dev`, worktree creation, and environment variable setup

### Step 2: Verify Authorization Is Explicit

Check that authorization is:
- From user (not agent)
- Explicit ("approved", "go", "approved: N.M")
- For the CURRENT issue (not old session)

### Step 3: Check needs-approval Label

```python
# Get issue labels
issue = github_issue_read(method="get", issue_number=N)
has_label = "needs-approval" in [l["name"] for l in issue["labels"]]

if has_label and explicit_authorization:
    # Label is informational, NOT blocking
    # Proceed with implementation
    # Optionally note: "needs-approval label can be removed"
```

### Step 4: Record Authorization Scope

Authorization applies to:
- Specific issue only
- Current phase/task only
- This session only (no carryover)

## Critical: Explicit Authorization Priority

When user provides explicit authorization, it **OVERRIDES** the needs-approval label.

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "approved" AND label present | PROCEED - explicit auth wins |
| "approved" AND no label | PROCEED |
| NO auth AND label present | HALT - wait for authorization |
| NO auth AND no label | Check other blockers |

### Step 5: Auto-Dispatch After Successful Verification

**🚫 CRITICAL: This step runs ONLY when ALL prior verification gates (Steps 1-4) pass. If ANY gate fails, HALT — do NOT dispatch.**

After all verification gates pass, determine the approval context and auto-dispatch:

#### Auto-Dispatch Context Differentiation

| Approval Context | How to Detect | Auto-Dispatch Target |
|------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Spec approval** | Issue title contains `[SPEC` or has `spec` label | `writing-plans --task create` |
| **Plan approval** | Issue has `plan` label or `[PLAN]` prefix in title | `executing-plans --task start` |
| **Already implemented** | `verify-already-implemented` returns positive | No dispatch — auto-close instead |

#### Auto-Dispatch Procedure

1. Determine approval context (spec vs plan) by checking:
   - Issue title format: `[SPEC` prefix = spec approval
   - Issue title format: `[PLAN]` prefix = plan approval
   - Labels: presence of `spec` or `plan` labels
   - Plan detection is via `plan` label or `[PLAN]` prefix in title (NOT via sub-issue relationship to spec)
2. **If spec approval:** Invoke `writing-plans --task create` with context:
   - `spec_issue=#N` (the approved spec issue number)
   - `GIT_OWNER`, `GIT_REPO`, `WORKTREE_PATH` from session
3. **If plan approval:** Invoke `executing-plans --task start` with context:
   - `plan_issue=#N` (the approved plan issue number)
   - `spec_issue=#M` (extracted from plan body — the spec reference)
   - `GIT_OWNER`, `GIT_REPO`, `WORKTREE_PATH` from session
4. **Chat output:** Clearly indicate the transition:
   - Spec approval: "Verification passed → Creating implementation plan"
   - Plan approval: "Verification passed → Starting implementation"

#### Spec Revision Revocation Detection

If a spec is revised (status changed to `REVISED - NEEDS APPROVAL`):

1. Search for `[PLAN]` issues that reference the spec number in their body
2. Mark found plans for audit (their authorization is revoked by the spec revision)
3. Report affected plans in chat output

#### Auto-Dispatch Edge Cases

- **Spec already has a plan:** `writing-plans --task create` handles this (skips or updates per its existing logic)
- **Multi-task plan with missing sub-issues:** `verify-sub-issues` gate fails → HALT, no dispatch
- **Batch approval:** Each plan in batch gets its own dispatch cycle after batch state is established

## Context Required

- Related tasks: `verify-sub-issues`, `verify-codebase`
- Auto-dispatch targets: `writing-plans` (spec approval), `executing-plans` (plan approval)
- Dispatch context for plan approval: pass `plan_issue=#N` and `spec_issue=#M` (extracted from plan body)
- Label state machine: `141-planning-status-tracking.md §10` (remove `needs-approval`, add `in-progress` on approval)
