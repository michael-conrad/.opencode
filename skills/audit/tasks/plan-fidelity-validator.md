# Task: plan-fidelity-knowledge-supporter

## Purpose

Validate evidence collected by the Investigator for plan-fidelity audit. Reads `evidence.yaml`, cross-checks each evidence item against source data (spec files, plan files, live tool calls), and writes `reasoning.yaml` with validated evidence and source references. This is the Validator role in the 4-role chain — it validates and supports, it does NOT evaluate or judge.


## Dispatch Contract

- `spec_local_dir`: Local directory containing spec files
- `artifact_evidence_dir`: Directory for evidence artifacts — contains `evidence.yaml` from Investigator
- `github.owner`, `github.repo` available

## Entry Criteria

- `evidence.yaml` exists at `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/evidence.yaml` — produced by the Investigator role
- `spec_local_dir` is present and non-empty — contains at minimum `spec.md`
- Plan files exist in `spec_local_dir/` — either `plan.md` + `plan-*.md` phase files, or plan embedded in spec body
- Write access to `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/`

## Exit Criteria

- Every evidence item in `evidence.yaml` validated against source data
- Unverifiable items flagged with `unverifiable: true` and a reason
- Source references recorded for every validated item
- `reasoning.yaml` written to `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/reasoning.yaml`
- No PASS/FAIL judgments in output — validated evidence only

## Procedure

### Step 0: Pre-clean

- [ ] 0. Remove `reasoning.yaml` if it exists from a prior run: `rm -f {project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/reasoning.yaml`

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Validation Gate

Validate that all required inputs are present before proceeding:

- [ ] 1. Verify `evidence.yaml` exists at `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/evidence.yaml`
- [ ] 2. Verify `spec_local_dir` is present and non-empty — glob `**/*.md` in `<spec_local_dir>/`
- [ ] 3. If `evidence.yaml` is missing, return BLOCKED:

```yaml
status: BLOCKED
error: MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT
missing: "evidence.yaml"
remediation: "evidence.yaml is required for plan-fidelity-knowledge-supporter. The Investigator role must produce evidence.yaml before the Validator can validate it."
```

- [ ] 4. If `spec_local_dir` is missing or empty, return BLOCKED:

```yaml
status: BLOCKED
error: MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT
missing: "spec_local_dir"
remediation: "spec_local_dir is required for plan-fidelity-knowledge-supporter. The orchestrator must provide a valid local directory containing spec Markdown files."
```

**This gate fires BEFORE any other step.** If any criterion fails, the task returns BLOCKED immediately.

### Step 2: Read evidence.yaml

- [ ] 1. Read `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/evidence.yaml`
- [ ] 2. Parse all top-level sections: `spec`, `plan`, `structural_alignment`, `content_evidence`, `blast_radius`, `cross_reference_evidence`
- [ ] 3. Build an inventory of all evidence items — each item is a discrete claim that must be validated

### Step 3: Validate Spec Evidence

Validate each item in the `spec` section against the actual spec files:

- [ ] 1. **SC table** — for each SC in `spec.sc_table`, verify the SC exists in `spec_local_dir/spec.md` with matching ID, description, and evidence type
- [ ] 2. **Files affected** — for each file in `spec.files_affected`, verify the file path is listed in the spec's Files Affected table
- [ ] 3. **Phases** — for each phase in `spec.phases`, verify the phase name and description match the spec body
- [ ] 4. **Cross-references** — for each issue reference in `spec.cross_references.issue_refs`, verify the reference appears in the spec body
- [ ] 5. **Delegation refs** — for each delegation reference in `spec.delegation_refs`, verify the directive and target appear in the spec body
- [ ] 6. **Scope** — verify `spec.scope.in_scope` and `spec.scope.out_of_scope` match the spec body

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "spec.sc_table.SC-1"
  source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""  # non-empty if validated=false — what the source actually says
```

### Step 4: Validate Plan Evidence

Validate each item in the `plan` section against the actual plan files:

- [ ] 1. **Phase table** — for each phase in `plan.phase_table`, verify the phase name, dispatch mode, and description match the plan files
- [ ] 2. **Steps** — for each step in `plan.steps`, verify the global number, phase, description, dispatch indicator, sub-bullets, and SC references match the plan files
- [ ] 3. **TDD checkpoints** — verify `plan.tdd_checkpoints` matches the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR structure in the plan
- [ ] 4. **Admonishments** — verify `plan.admonishments.prologue_present`, `epilogue_present`, and `canonical_text_match` by reading the plan files
- [ ] 5. **Plan scope** — for each file in `plan.plan_scope.files_referenced`, verify the file path appears in plan steps
- [ ] 6. **Cross-references** — for each issue reference in `plan.cross_references.issue_refs`, verify the reference appears in the plan body
- [ ] 7. **Delegation definitions** — for each definition in `plan.delegation_definitions`, verify the directive and concrete definition appear in the plan
- [ ] 8. **Gate sequence** — verify `plan.gate_sequence` matches the pipeline gates referenced in plan steps
- [ ] 9. **Verification instructions** — for each instruction in `plan.verification_instructions`, verify the step number, SC ID, and required evidence type match the plan
- [ ] 10. **Z3 contract refs** — for each ref in `plan.z3_contract_refs`, verify the contract path is referenced in the plan
- [ ] 11. **Prescriptive content** — for each item in `plan.prescriptive_content`, verify the step number, type, and content match the plan

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "plan.phase_table.Phase-1"
  source: "<spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 5: Validate Structural Alignment Evidence

Validate each item in the `structural_alignment` section by cross-referencing spec and plan:

- [ ] 1. **Phase coverage** — for each entry in `structural_alignment.phase_coverage`, verify the spec phase exists in the spec and the plan phases exist in the plan
- [ ] 2. **Phase ordering** — verify `structural_alignment.phase_ordering.spec_order` matches the spec and `plan_order` matches the plan
- [ ] 3. **SC coverage** — for each entry in `structural_alignment.sc_coverage`, verify the SC ID exists in the spec and the plan steps exist in the plan
- [ ] 4. **File coverage** — for each entry in `structural_alignment.file_coverage`, verify the spec file exists in the spec's Files Affected and the plan steps exist in the plan
- [ ] 5. **Extra files** — for each file in `structural_alignment.extra_files`, verify it is referenced in plan steps but NOT in the spec's Files Affected
- [ ] 6. **Step numbering** — verify `structural_alignment.step_numbering` matches the actual numbering scheme in the plan
- [ ] 7. **Dispatch mode consistency** — for each entry in `structural_alignment.dispatch_mode_consistency`, verify the declared dispatch matches the phase table and step indicators match the plan steps
- [ ] 8. **Checklist format** — verify `structural_alignment.checklist_format` by spot-checking plan steps for `- [ ] N.` format
- [ ] 9. **One-step protocol** — verify `structural_alignment.one_step_protocol_present` by reading the plan prologue
- [ ] 10. **Sub-step expansion** — for each step in `structural_alignment.sub_step_expansion.multi_action_steps`, verify the step describes more than one atomic action

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "structural_alignment.phase_coverage[0]"
  source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md + <spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 6: Validate Content Evidence

Validate each item in the `content_evidence` section:

- [ ] 1. **Approach** — verify `content_evidence.approach.spec_approach` matches the spec body and `plan_approach` matches the plan body
- [ ] 2. **Edge cases** — for each entry in `content_evidence.edge_cases`, verify the description and spec source exist in the spec, and the plan steps exist in the plan
- [ ] 3. **Error recovery** — for each entry in `content_evidence.error_recovery`, verify the description and spec source exist in the spec, and the plan steps exist in the plan
- [ ] 4. **Root cause** — verify `content_evidence.root_cause.spec_description` matches the spec and `plan_phase_addressing` matches a plan phase
- [ ] 5. **Delegation completeness** — for each entry in `content_evidence.delegation_completeness`, verify the directive exists in the spec and the `has_concrete_definition` value matches the plan
- [ ] 6. **Gate sequence** — verify `content_evidence.gate_sequence` matches the pipeline gates referenced in plan steps
- [ ] 7. **Verification evidence types** — for each entry in `content_evidence.verification_evidence_types`, verify the SC ID exists in the spec, the `spec_declared_type` matches the spec's SC table, and the `plan_required_type` matches the plan's verification instructions
- [ ] 8. **Cost-frame prose** — for each entry in `content_evidence.cost_frame_prose`, verify the `present` value by reading the phase's instructions in the plan
- [ ] 9. **SC gate language** — verify `content_evidence.sc_gate_language.present` by reading the plan for all-or-nothing gate references

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "content_evidence.approach"
  source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md + <spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 7: Validate Blast Radius Evidence

Validate each item in the `blast_radius` section:

- [ ] 1. For each entry in `blast_radius`, verify the file exists in the plan's scope
- [ ] 2. For each dependent symbol, verify it is a real symbol via `srclight_get_dependents` on the file
- [ ] 3. Verify `addressed_in_plan` by checking whether the dependent symbol appears in plan steps

If `srclight_get_dependents` is unavailable, mark blast radius items as `unverifiable: true` with reason `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE`.

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "blast_radius[0]"
  source: "srclight_get_dependents on <file>"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 8: Validate Cross-Reference Evidence

Validate each item in the `cross_reference_evidence` section:

- [ ] 1. **Issue refs** — for each entry in `cross_reference_evidence.issue_refs`, verify `exists` by calling `github_issue_read(method=get, issue_number=N)` and verify `relevant` by reading the issue body
- [ ] 2. **File refs** — for each entry in `cross_reference_evidence.file_refs`, verify `exists` by calling `glob` on the file path

If `github_issue_read` is unavailable, mark issue refs as `unverifiable: true` with reason `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE`.

For each item, record:

```yaml
- item: "cross_reference_evidence.issue_refs[0]"
  source: "github_issue_read on #N"
  validated: true | false
  unverifiable: false
  unverifiable_reason: ""
  discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 9: Write reasoning.yaml

Write all validated evidence to `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/reasoning.yaml`:

```yaml
generated_at: "<ISO timestamp>"
supporter_model: "<model>"
evidence_source: "{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/evidence.yaml"
total_items: <N>
validated_count: <N>
unverifiable_count: <N>
discrepancy_count: <N>
spec_validation:
  - item: "spec.sc_table.SC-1"
    source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
plan_validation:
  - item: "plan.phase_table.Phase-1"
    source: "<spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
structural_alignment_validation:
  - item: "structural_alignment.phase_coverage[0]"
    source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md + <spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
content_evidence_validation:
  - item: "content_evidence.approach"
    source: "<spec_local_dir>/spec.md + <spec_local_dir>/plan.md"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
blast_radius_validation:
  - item: "blast_radius[0]"
    source: "srclight_get_dependents on <file>"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
cross_reference_validation:
  - item: "cross_reference_evidence.issue_refs[0]"
    source: "github_issue_read on #N"
    validated: true | false
    unverifiable: false
    unverifiable_reason: ""
    discrepancy: ""
```

### Step 10: Return Frugal Result Contract

```yaml
status: DONE | BLOCKED
artifact_path: "{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/plan-fidelity/reasoning.yaml"
summary: "Evidence validated: {validated_count}/{total_items} items confirmed. {unverifiable_count} unverifiable, {discrepancy_count} discrepancies found."
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `evidence.yaml` missing | Return BLOCKED — `MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT` |
| `spec_local_dir` missing or empty | Return BLOCKED — `MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT` |
| No plan files found in `spec_local_dir/` | Return BLOCKED — `MISSING_PLAN` |
| `srclight_get_dependents` unavailable | Mark blast radius items as `unverifiable: true`, continue |
| `github_issue_read` unavailable | Mark cross-reference items as `unverifiable: true`, continue |
| Write permission denied | Return BLOCKED — cannot write reasoning |
| Evidence item references non-existent source | Record `validated: false` with `discrepancy` describing what was found (or not found) |
