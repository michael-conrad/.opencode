# behavioral-testing — the tests-v2 harness gate

1. **Harness only, scoped per tier (.opencode#2582).** Scenario scripts carry a
   tier designation (`SCENARIO_TIER`): tier-2 (Docker harness) and tier-3 (host
   harness) behavioral evidence is produced by `.opencode/tests-v2/` — read
   [`tests-v2/AGENTS.md`](../../tests-v2/AGENTS.md) first, every time. Scenario
   scripts via `behavior_run()`, environment via `with-test-home`; an ad-hoc
   `opencode run` is never behavioral evidence for tier-2/tier-3. Invoke only
   as `bash .opencode/tests-v2/behaviors/<scenario>.sh` from the project root —
   never bare `opencode run` (SQLite session conflicts with the desktop app),
   never inline or from-scratch test infrastructure.
   **Tier-1 (simple card changes, eligibility by agent judgment — never a
   scripted checklist):** evidence is a recorded clean-room sub-agent dispatch
   that verifies the change directly — the dispatch prompt, the criterion
   judged, and the returned verdict are persisted into the owning issue's
   artifact area (audit dir). No harness run is required for tier-1 evidence.
2. **Clean-room isolation is inviolable.** The test home is built from the
    pushed effective commit — never from session state. Do NOT pass session
    credentials through the `env -i` allowlist, do NOT inject config entries
    or secrets into the seeded test environment (including via per-scenario
    fixtures), do NOT weaken isolation to make a failing test pass. If a
    behavioral SC needs something the isolated environment cannot provide,
    that is a spec problem — re-scope the SC at the spec, never the isolation.
    (Observed regression, #2538: a fixture was authored to inject an MCP entry
    into the seeded test config and an allowlist credential passthrough was
    proposed; both ruled a bypass of the isolation the harness exists to
    enforce.)
    **Docker-tier isolation contract (tier-2, .opencode#2582):** containers run
    as the invoking uid:gid, the only host mount is the project's `tmp/`
    (mounted at the same absolute path), no production folder (`.tools/`, repo
    worktree outside `tmp/`, `$HOME`, either `.issues/` store) is mounted into
    or copied into the container, the test home starts bare of agent-managed
    tooling (no binary/uv copies), and the image's baked base tools (pinned
    upstream versions) are the harness's instruments. **Host-path isolation
    mandates** — the snap prohibitions (`snap run`, `/snap/bin/opencode`),
    `USER=opencode-test-user`, and the production-DB sha256 check — apply to
    **tier-3 (host) runs**; on the Docker tier the equivalent protections are
    structural (the container cannot reach production paths at all).
3. **Scenario authoring.** Copy `template.sh`; the script is an artifact-only
   generator — it runs `behavior_run`, exits 0, and NEVER evaluates output.
   `SCENARIO_NAME` is kebab-case and MUST match any
   `fixtures/setup/<name>.sh` fixture filename; prompt references to issue
   content require fixture files under `fixtures/issues/{N}/` (§3). Every run
   follows the ordered precondition cycle: commit → push → fetch/verify →
   run (§4).
4. **Artifacts.** Harness output lands where `behavior_run` writes it
   (`./tmp/behavioral-evidence-<scenario>-<phase>-<model>/`, tests-v2/AGENTS.md
   §2); preserve verification artifacts issue-keyed under
   `{project_root}/tmp/{issue-N}/artifacts/`. Never fabricate, move, or
   synthesize artifacts — a missing export is remediated per §10, never
   reconstructed.
5. **Standard evaluator sub-agent.** After every behavioral run, dispatch the
   clean-room evaluator — Read [Clean-Room Behavioral
   Evaluation](references/behavioral-evaluation.md). It receives ONLY the
   artifact directory and the SC criteria — no orchestrator context, no
   expected outcomes, no cached results — reads `session.yaml` as the PRIMARY
   source, writes `evaluation-<timestamp>.yaml` into the artifact directory,
   and returns the YAML verdict record. "Artifact generated" is NEVER a valid
   PASS verdict for a behavioral SC.
6. **Two-SC pattern.** Artifact generation (run, produce `session.yaml`) and
   clean-room evaluation (separate sub-agent reads the artifacts) are separate
   SCs and separate dispatches — never merged.
7. **Prompts are real-domain tasks.** Interview/prose-recall prompts are a
   hard FAIL (§11).
8. **Default model is single-sourced.** `DEFAULT_TEST_MODEL` in
   `default-model.sh` runs every test; model-shopping is prohibited (R-20,
   §10.6). Remediation targets the defect classes, never model selection.
8a. **Pre-supplied environment.** The harness pre-supplies everything the
   scenario's task needs — deck-mandated CLIs baked into the image,
   authenticated remote, bootstrapped store, seeded credentials/env
   (tests-v2/AGENTS.md §3a). Run time spent on environment discovery
   (finding CLIs, reverse-engineering APIs, deriving auth shapes,
   discovering store layout) is a harness/scenario defect to fix at the
   fixture/image layer — never model behavior, never prompt-tolerated.
9. **Supervise every run — 60-second poll cycle, update turn follows the poll's reminder.**
   Launch the run in background. **The supervision cycle is two turns, strictly
   alternating: (1) a tool call — `sleep 60`, then `.opencode/tests-v2/poll-run.sh
   <pinned-session-db> <poll#>` — whose output ENDS WITH THE REMINDER to
   deliver the analysis in chat (the poll script prints it); (2) the very next
   message is the text-only update — the analysis and NO tool call.** The reminder block in the poll
   output is the trigger; never chain another tool call before delivering the
   update. **The 60-second cycle is absolute — no longer sleeps (240s/300s+)
   between polls, ever (observed defect, #2570). Never pipe, grep, head, tail,
   or otherwise filter or truncate the poll output — the trailing reminder is
   the update trigger, and filtering it out silently suppresses the update
   turn (observed defect, #2570: a `grep | head` poll invocation dropped the
   reminder and produced a run of bare bash calls with zero in-chat updates).**
   **Never kill by name pattern.** Run cleanup and abort kill only the PIDs the
   agent itself launched — record the PID at launch and re-verify survivors by
   PID (`kill -9 <pid>`, `ps -p <pid>`), never by a name match. A pattern kill
   (`pkill -9 -f opencode`, or any pattern broad enough to match unrelated
   processes) kills every matching process on the machine — observed
   2026-10-11: a cleanup pass pattern-matched `opencode` and terminated the
   developer's main opencode session mid-work. Scoped diagnosis greps are fine;
   kill signals are PID-addressed only.
   The supervision loop is continuous — it does NOT yield to the
   developer between polls; mid-cycle yielding exits the loop and is the
   defect corrected in #2561. The cycle ends only when monitoring is
   conclusive: run completion, a handled hard-abort signal, the
   evidence-sufficiency early exit, or the verdict-confirmed conclusion
   (below). The developer's UI
   collapses Shell calls to bare command lines, so tool results, echo-carried
   updates, and text riding in tool-call turns all fail to surface (verified
   live, #2557; the standalone text turn is the only delivery that works). The
   update states: what the run agent is doing right now, what it intends next,
   whether that serves the scenario's goal, and which hard-abort signals (§14)
   have fired — read from the agent's actual words and work, not counters.
   **The loop is CONTINUOUS until conclusive (#2561 developer correction):
   never yield to the developer mid-cycle — a poll cycle ends only when the
   run is conclusive (run completion, a fired hard-abort signal handled, the
   evidence-sufficiency early exit, or the verdict-confirmed conclusion), not
   on a schedule or after each
   update. The per-poll sequence is: poll tool call → analyze its evidence →
   report in chat → next poll tool call, repeating inside the working turn.**
   **Verdict-confirmed conclusion — MANDATORY, same cycle (.opencode#2594).**
   When a poll's semantic check confirms the SC's verdict state — **green**
   (the scenario's goal condition observed met in the run agent's actual
   words and work) or **red** (the goal condition observed failed, or a
   run-fatal defect observed) — the supervisor MUST conclude the run in that
   same cycle: PID-addressed kill of the run process tree (re-verify gone by
   PID), §10.5 export when the artifact set is incomplete, and a recorded
   confirmation in the evidence directory naming the confirming poll, the
   event citations, and the verdict state — then proceed to evaluation.
   Polling past the confirming poll is a supervision defect: once the
   outcome is known, further cycles cannot change the verdict and are waste
   by definition (observed defect, #2594: green confirmed at poll 47, polls
   continued through 50). Post-confirmation tail hygiene by the run agent is
   not evidence — do not wait for it. This trigger is stronger than the
   evidence-sufficiency early exit (#2538): sufficiency judges value;
   verdict-confirmed is mandatory once the outcome is known. The
   confirmation judgment is intent-decidable — judgment on the event
   stream, never a scripted pattern match; the post-confirmation actions are
   mechanical.
    **Keep the todo list current with the run's state** — it renders
   persistently between updates. **Pin the polled DB to the active run's test
   home** (env-passed path, not newest-by-mtime): a zombie run from a prior
   kill can outlive its supervisor and pollute mtime-based selection — kill
   survivors with `kill -9` by PID and re-verify with `pgrep`. Activity or
   uptime proxies are INADMISSIBLE as the check; counters alone are not a
   finding. **When the DB is flat, distinguish generating from stalled by
   inference-load evidence — GPU utilization (`nvidia-smi`) and `ollama ps`:
   a busy GPU is generation in progress; an idle GPU with a flat DB is a
   stall signal. **Layered hang diagnosis (`.opencode#2547`): a hang verdict
   requires converging signals — session-DB flatness, WAL-growth stall, GPU
   utilization, and the ollama service log (`journalctl -u ollama`) — never a
   single one: a frozen WAL has a legitimate post-smoke steady state, and the
   server log is the tiebreaker (active `n_gen`/task activity in
   `journalctl -u ollama` means the run is generating regardless of
   client-side flatness). A server restart or error in the service log during
   a run marks the run environment-suspect: abort by PID, export, diagnose —
   never blind retry. Read-only host checks (`journalctl -u ollama`,
   `nvidia-smi`) are sanctioned per-poll supervision surfaces (developer
   direction, 2026-10-14); no host-state mutation. Abort completeness: after
   any run kill, enumerate survivors by recorded-PID descendants AND by
   test-home environment (a command-line check misses env-only carriers —
   observed orphan), kill them, and verify zero before proceeding. Orchestrated
   SC-verification runs launch with `BEHAVIOR_SEMANTIC_MONITOR=1` so
   determination records exist — unmonitored runs cannot resume through the
   §10.7 path (SC-8 determination gate).**
   **Cadence and gap claims are computed, never estimated:** record the nested
   run's launch time and every poll time, and derive any cadence or gap
   statement from those recorded timestamps — an assertion of compliance (or a
   "no gap" framing) built from an elapsed-time impression is a fabricated
   finding. If the run completed before the first poll, state that plainly,
   take the early-exit path, and report the actual timeline. **No blocking
   action longer than 60 s starts while a run is active** —
   dispatch clean-room evaluations at run boundaries (after the run ends),
   never mid-run. Abort on the hard-abort signals and record the diagnosis in
   the next update. **Early exit on evidence sufficiency (#2538):** when a
   poll's judgment finds the SC's evidence surface already complete and
   further running adds no value, conclude the run — kill, export per §10.5,
   record the sufficiency judgment, and proceed to evaluation. Waiting out a
   run whose evidence is captured burns inference for nothing. Whether the
   evidence surface is complete is a judgment call — never scripted. **Verdict
   for ceremony-escalation aborts:** a run aborted for ceremony escalation
   (self-inflicted detours — summoned machinery, tooling debugging, store
   initialization — the task never requires) whose root cause traces to deck
   wording is a **FAIL** verdict, remediated by the easy deck correction, and
   the scenario re-runs — never reclassified as inconclusive or worked around
   in the prompt.
10. **Timeouts and recovery.** Bash-tool timeout ≥ 600000 ms; on timeout,
    session resumption (`--continue`/`--session`) is the first-line recovery
    (§10.7); the §10 remediation paths replace model excuses and blind retries.
11. **Remote API tests are self-contained.** A behavioral SC requiring real
    remote API behavior opts into the harness's provisioned GitBucket container
    (`BEHAVIOR_NEEDS_REMOTE`; mechanics in tests-v2 §12) — no external server,
    no mock stand-in by default. For scenarios needing real **GitHub**-side
    repo targets, use the designated throwaway test repos (`test-submodule-1`,
    `test-submodule-2`) in the authenticated owner's namespace — owner
    resolution is deployment-local, never hardcoded — and never target
    production repos (developer direction, 2026-10-14).
