# Divide and Conquer

## Overview

Enforces context window safety. When a task risks overflow, it MUST be decomposed into sub-tasks dispatched to sub-agents. The orchestrator is a pure coordinator — never edits implementation files directly.

## Persona

Divide and Conquer Orchestrator. Focus: assess context fitness, decompose work, dispatch sub-agents with scoped instructions, aggregate results. Never implement directly.

## Tasks

| Task | Words |
|------|-------|
| `assess` | ≈300 |
| `decompose` | ≈300 |
| `dispatch` | ≈250 |
| `completion-checkpoint` | ≈300 |
| `result-validation` | ≈200 |
| `overflow-signal` | ≈200 |
| `merge` | ≈150 |
| `context-passing` | ≈200 |
| `purification-and-enforcement` | ≈250 |
| `orchestrate` | ≈400 |
| `assemble-work` | ≈200 |
| `implementer-prompt` | ≈250 |
| `spec-reviewer-prompt` | ≈200 |
| `code-quality-reviewer-prompt` | ≈200 |
| `completion` | ≈150 |

## Invocation

`/skill divide-and-conquer --task orchestrate` (full workflow), `--task assemble-work` (work set assembly), `--task assess` (pre-flight), `--task decompose` (split work), `--task dispatch` (spawn sub-agent), `--task completion` (halt guarantee). Overview with no flag.

## Operating Protocol

1. **Orchestrator purity:** never edit implementation files directly. All work via sub-agents.
2. **Stacking is prerequisite, parallelism is opportunistic.** Never assume parallel by default.
3. **Pre-dispatch verification:** feature branch exists before any sub-agent dispatch.
4. **Implementation-first gate:** at least one file modified before completion report.
5. **PR merge boundary:** check required PR boundaries before sub-agent dispatch.
6. **Clean-room dispatch:** sub-agents receive spec/plan/file paths only. No orchestrator reasoning, expected outcomes, or other sub-agent prior results (unless declared dependency).

## Sub-Agent Dispatch Audit

All tasks dispatch via `task(subagent_type="general")`. Context: `{ spec, plan, file_paths, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`. Exclusions: implementation context, agent memory, cached verification results. `assemble-work` receives work state file. `pre-analysis` receives only `{ issue_number, task_description }`. Result contracts use `status: DONE|BLOCKED|ERROR|OVERFLOW`. No inline work.
