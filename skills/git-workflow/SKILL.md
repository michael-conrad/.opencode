# Skill: git-workflow

## Overview

Git Workflow Enforcer. Three-branch model: feature → dev → main. AI commits blocked on protected branches. Feature branches merge to `dev` via PR. Squash at PR creation only. Submodule-aware.

## Persona

Git Workflow Enforcer. Focus: three-branch workflow, block AI on protected branches, squash-on-PR-only discipline.

## Tasks

| Task | Words |
|------|-------|
| `pre-work` | ≈480 |
| `implementation` | ≈400 |
| `review-prep` | ≈390 |
| `pr-creation` | ≈385 |
| `rebase-pending` | ≈1666 |
| `cleanup` | ≈950 |
| `release-promotion` | ≈500 |
| `check-pr` | ≈50 |
| `provenance` | ≈460 |
| `pair-pre-work` | ≈400 |
| `pair-commit` | ≈350 |
| `pair-pr-creation` | ≈300 |
| `pair-cleanup` | ≈350 |
| `pair-mode-resume` | ≈300 |
| `completion` | ≈200 |

## Routing: Feature PR vs Release PR

| Request Type | Target |
|---|---|
| Feature PR (feature/* → dev) | `pr-creation-workflow` skill |
| Release PR (dev → main) | `git-workflow --task release-promotion` |

## Invocation

`skill({name: "git-workflow"})` — load the skill, then dispatch a task:

| Task | Dispatch |
|------|----------|
| `pre-work` | `task(..., prompt: "execute pre-work task from git-workflow")` |
| `implementation` | `task(..., prompt: "execute implementation task from git-workflow")` |
| `review-prep` | `task(..., prompt: "execute review-prep task from git-workflow")` |
| `pr-creation` | `task(..., prompt: "execute pr-creation task from git-workflow")` |
| `rebase-pending` | `task(..., prompt: "execute rebase-pending task from git-workflow")` |
| `cleanup` | `task(..., prompt: "execute cleanup task from git-workflow")` |
| `release-promotion` | `task(..., prompt: "execute release-promotion task from git-workflow")` |
| `check-pr` | `task(..., prompt: "execute check-pr task from git-workflow")` |
| `provenance` | `task(..., prompt: "execute provenance task from git-workflow")` |
| `completion` | `task(..., prompt: "execute completion task from git-workflow")` |

**CLI equivalent (for human TUI use):** `/skill git-workflow --task <task>`

## Sub-Agent Tasks for Submodule Operations

| Sub-Agent Task | Trigger | Dispatch Context (MUST receive) | Exclusions (MUST NOT receive) | Words |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| `submodule-tag-prework` | pre-work Step 3.5 | parent_repo, issue_number, submodule_paths | Implementation context, agent memory, other sub-agent results | ≈400 |
| `submodule-feature-push` | review-prep Step 0 | parent_repo, issue_number, submodule_paths, submodule_branches | Implementation context, agent memory, orchestrator reasoning | ≈450 |
| `submodule-liveness-check` | enforcement-gate Step 0, PR-time | submodule_paths, referenced_hashes, parent_repo, issue_number | Implementation context, agent memory, prior verification results | ≈350 |
| `submodule-dev-restore` | cleanup Step 1.9 | submodule_paths | Implementation context, agent memory, other sub-agent results | ≈300 |

## Operating Protocol

1. **Worktree first:** set `worktree.path` before file ops (direct-branch mode when `WORKTREE_REQUIRED` not set).
2. **Protected branches:** never commit to `main`/`dev`.
3. **Squash discipline:** squash ONLY at PR creation, not during feature dev.
4. **Clean-room content diff:** before branch deletion, verify content exists on target branch.
5. **Compare URL base:** feature → `compare/dev...<branch>`. Release → `compare/main...dev`.
6. **Submodule repos:** git ops from inside submodule dir. No `--recursive`.
7. **Pair mode:** `pair-*` branches use WIP-commit switching, not worktrees.
8. **Adversarial-audit invocation:** after PR merge verification, invoke `adversarial-audit --task closure-verification --pr <N>` with `audit_phase: post_merge`.
9. **No dependency-sync PRs:** tag-based hash permanence replaces intermediate PRs. Submodule SHAs are preserved via parent-repo-prefixed tags. See AGENTS.md §Tag Layers.

## Sub-Agent Dispatch Audit

All tasks dispatch via `task(subagent_type="general")` with `{ branch_name, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`, excluding implementation context and agent memory. `pr-creation` receives spec summary. `cleanup` receives PR merge status. `provenance` receives submodule path. `pre-analysis` receives only `{ issue_number, task_description, github.owner, github.repo }`. No inline work.

Submodule sub-agents (`submodule-tag-prework`, `submodule-feature-push`, `submodule-liveness-check`, `submodule-dev-restore`) receive scoped context per the Sub-Agent Tasks for Submodule Operations table above. All are clean-room dispatches — no implementation context, agent memory, or orchestrator reasoning shared. Submodule git operations are NEVER performed inline.
