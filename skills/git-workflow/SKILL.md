name: git-workflow
description: Use when creating a branch, committing changes, pushing work, or creating a PR. Also use when git rebase/merge produces conflicts — invoke conflict-resolution skill for classification. Also use when user says "check pr" or "check prs" to trigger PR state verification and cleanup if merged. Triggers on: branch, commit, push, PR, pull request, pre-work, review-prep, feature branch, dev branch, squash, conflict, merge conflict, rebase conflict, check pr, check prs, check pull request, check pull requests.

# Skill: git-workflow

## Overview

Git Workflow Enforcer ensuring all git operations follow the three-branch model: feature → dev → main. AI commits are blocked on protected branches. All feature branches merge to `dev` via PR. Squashing is ONLY at PR creation time, not during implementation.

## Persona

You are a Git Workflow Enforcer. Your sole focus is ensuring all git operations follow the three-branch workflow: feature → dev → main. AI commits are blocked on protected branches. Squashing is ONLY for PR creation, not during feature branch development.

## Tasks

| Task | Purpose | Words |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `pre-work` | Verify authorization, create worktree | ~420 |
| `implementation` | Handle WIP commits during implementation | ~400 |
| `review-prep` | Push branch, generate compare URL for review | ~560 |
| `pr-creation` | Squash, push, create PR via GitHub MCP | ~640 |
| `rebase-pending` | Rebase other open PRs after merge, classify conflicts | ~550 |
| `cleanup` | Delete merged branches, clean stale refs | ~800 |
| `completion` | Ensure mandatory completion steps run regardless of workflow outcome | ~200 |
| `release-promotion` | Automate submodule dev → main promotion and tagging | ~350 |
| `check-pr` | List all PRs (open + merged); if merged found, activate cleanup | ~50 |

## Invocation

- `/skill git-workflow --task pre-work` - BEFORE implementation starts (MUST invoke after approval-gate passes)
- `/skill git-workflow --task implementation` - During implementation work
- `/skill git-workflow --task review-prep` - AFTER implementation done (MUST invoke, no decision point)
- `/skill git-workflow --task pr-creation` - When user says "create a PR"
- `/skill git-workflow --task rebase-pending` - After PR merge, before cleanup
- `/skill git-workflow --task cleanup` - After PR merge confirmed
- `/skill git-workflow --task release-promotion` - When promoting dev → main with submodules, or explicit "promote/push submodule" instruction
- `/skill git-workflow --task check-pr` - When user says "check pr" / "check prs" / "check pull request(s)"
- `/skill git-workflow --task completion` - Invoke when workflow halts at any point
- `/skill git-workflow` - Overview only

**⚠️ COMPLETION GUARANTEE:** If this workflow halts at ANY point — including error, failure, or early termination — you MUST invoke `--task completion` before halting. The completion subtask ensures mandatory steps (status report, URL, verification gates) are never skipped. It is idempotent and safe to invoke multiple times.

## Operating Protocol

1. **Mandatory invocation (no decision point):** pre-work is invoked after approval-gate passes; review-prep is invoked after implementation completes — the agent MUST invoke both at the appropriate time, never skip them, and never prompt for invocation.
2. **Phase sequence:** Pre-work (Phase 1) → Implementation (user-driven) → review-prep (Phase 3, MANDATORY, MUST invoke after implementation) → pr-creation (explicit instruction only) → cleanup (after merge).
3. **review-prep is mandatory:** Skipping it after implementation is a CRITICAL GUIDELINE VIOLATION. The agent MUST invoke `/skill git-workflow --task review-prep` after implementation completes.
4. **PR requires explicit instruction:** "approved"/"go" authorizes implementation ONLY — not PR creation.
5. **Chat output order:** Executive summary FIRST, URL LAST. Never put URL before summary.
6. **Compare URLs use `dev` as base:** Feature branches target `dev`, not `main`.
7. **Squash to single commit before any PR:** No exceptions.
8. **Never merge PRs:** Human-only operation.

## Role in Orchestration Architecture

Git-workflow handles **pure git operations only**. Implementation logic is handled by `divide-and-conquer` orchestration layer.

**What git-workflow DOES:** Git operations (worktree, branch, commit, push), git state checks, git cleanup.
**What git-workflow DOES NOT do:** Implementation decisions, file editing, spec reading, authorization checks (handled by approval-gate + orchestration layer).

## Edge Case: Already Implemented (No Changes)

When spec investigation reveals ZERO file modifications: skip branch creation, skip PR workflow, close issue directly with verification comment. ANY file modified (including docs/guidelines) requires full PR workflow.

## Critical Workflow Sequence

```
Implementation complete
    ↓
review-prep MUST be invoked (Phase 3)
    ↓
Push branch → Generate compare URL → HALT
    ↓
(Developer reviews via GitHub diff)
    ↓
Developer says "create a PR"
    ↓
pr-creation: Squash → Push → Create PR → HALT
    ↓
(Developer merges PR)
    ↓
Developer confirms "PR merged"
    ↓
cleanup: Verify merge via API → Close issues
```

## Sub-Agent Spawning

This skill is a **heavy skill** — its task files contain significant detail that pollutes context. When the main agent needs git-workflow execution, consider spawning a sub-agent via the `task` tool:

1. Main agent loads this dispatch document (~570 words)
2. Main agent identifies the needed task (e.g., `pre-work`, `cleanup`)
3. Main agent spawns sub-agent: `task(subagent_type="general", prompt="Use git-workflow skill --task <task-name> with context: <session-context>")`
4. Sub-agent loads: this SKILL.md + relevant task file + required guidelines
5. Sub-agent executes task in isolation, returns structured result
6. Main agent receives result summary — no full git-workflow content in main context

**Sub-agent context parameters:** Pass `WORKTREE_PATH`, `BRANCH_NAME`, `GIT_OWNER`, `GIT_REPO`, `DEV_NAME`, `DEV_EMAIL` from session init.

**⚠️ Worktree pass-through is MANDATORY:** When spawning sub-agents from a worktree context, `WORKTREE_PATH` MUST be included in the dispatch prompt. Sub-agents that perform git operations without `WORKTREE_PATH` will silently modify the main repo — this is a CRITICAL GUIDELINE VIOLATION (see #741).

## Live Verification Requirements

**🚫 CRITICAL: Every git-workflow task MUST verify actual git/GitHub state via tool calls before acting on claims. Do NOT trust cached values, assumed branch names, or claimed merge status without direct evidence.**

### Verification Matrix

| Verification Point | Tool Call | Expected Evidence | Applies To |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **Branch state** | `git branch --show-current` | Current branch name matches expected | pre-work, implementation, rebase-pending |
| **Working tree cleanliness** | `git status --porcelain` | Empty output (no uncommitted changes) | review-prep, pr-creation |
| **Worktree location** | `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` | Returns worktree path (not main repo) | pre-work, implementation |
| **Commit/push state** | `git log dev..HEAD --oneline` | At least one commit ahead of dev | review-prep, pr-creation |
| **Tracking branch** | `git branch -vv` | `[origin/<branch>]` tracking exists | review-prep |
| **Unpushed commits** | `git diff @{u} HEAD` | Empty diff (all commits pushed) | review-prep |
| **PR merge status** | `github_pull_request_read(method=get)` | `merged_at` is not None | cleanup |
| **Sub-issue closure** | `github_issue_read(method=get_sub_issues)` | All sub-issues state=closed | cleanup |
| **File existence** | `git status --porcelain` | No uncommitted files (all committed) | pr-creation, implementation |
| **Staged state** | `git diff --staged` | Expected changes are staged | commit-prep, pr-creation |
| **Unstaged changes** | `git diff` | Empty (no unstaged changes) | pr-creation |
| **Worktree environment** | `echo $WORKTREE_PATH` | Non-empty path matching worktree dir | pre-work, implementation |
| **Stash state** | `git stash list` | Expected number of stashes (usually 0) | cleanup |

### Adversarial Verification Principles

1. **No cached trust:** Re-verify git state before every state-modifying operation (commit, push, squash, rebase)
2. **Evidence required:** Each verification point MUST produce a tool-call artifact — assertions without evidence are VERIFICATION-GAP findings
3. **Contradiction detection:** If actual state contradicts expected state, classify as a finding before proceeding

### Finding Classification

| Finding | Problem Class | Classification | Action |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Branch name doesn't match expected | STRUCTURE-VIOLATION | auto-fix | Report actual branch, verify worktree context |
| Working tree dirty when should be clean | VERIFICATION-GAP | conditional | Commit or stash before proceeding |
| `merged_at` is None (no merge) | CONFLICTING | flag-for-review | HALT — do not close issues |
| Tracking branch missing | MISSING-ELEMENT | auto-fix | Push with `-u` to establish tracking |
| Unpushed commits detected | VERIFICATION-GAP | conditional | Push before generating compare URL |
| WORKTREE_PATH empty/not set | STRUCTURE-VIOLATION | auto-fix | HALT — fatal error, cannot proceed safely |
| Staged changes differ from expected | CONFLICTING | flag-for-review | Verify staging matches intent before commit |
| Sub-issue closed without merged PR | VERIFICATION-GAP | flag-for-review | Investigate closure reason, may need reopen |
