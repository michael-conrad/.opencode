# gradle

This card owns Gradle as a build/run tool — running builds, configuring the
build, and assembling distributable artifacts. It stays top-level because its
intent space is not contained by Java work: build configuration touches no Java
code, and a future Kotlin/Scala card would need it.

## Wrapper discipline

- Invoke builds through the repository's wrapper (`./gradlew`) when it ships
  one — the repository here is the root repo of the working set: for a
  change targeting a submodule of a parent repository, that is the parent
  repository, per the floor's Build-tooling exclusivity rule. The wrapper
  pins the distribution version the project was built to
  work with; a bare `gradle` uses whatever the machine has.
- When the root repository has no wrapper, the canonical command comes from
  the root repo's declared build manifest — ask when the manifest does not
  declare it; never guess.
- Build execution is exclusive to the wrapper (or, wrapperless, the
  declared-framework command): an alternative Gradle distribution, a bare
  `gradle`, a sibling wrapper, or any ad-hoc binary gradle invocation is
  prohibited — including when the wrapper's own build invocation just failed;
  the failed invocation is never an authorization for a substitute toolchain.
- When the sanctioned workflow's failure is verified, the disposition is
  report-with-evidence-and-halt (a cannot-continue state) or routing to the
  owning ticket — never invoking a different build toolchain.

## Canonical-command sourcing

Build/test commands come from the repository's declared build manifest. The
manifest's declared Gradle commands are the canonical ones — run them as
declared; do not substitute task lists of your own invention.

## Packaging depth

Fat-jar assembly — what the artifact contains and which service registrations
must survive aggregation — is the detail card:
[packaging-spi.md](references/packaging-spi.md). Load it when configuring
shadowJar or any dependency-bundling jar task.
