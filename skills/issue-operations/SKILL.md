# Skill: issue-operations

## Overview

Platform-agnostic Issue Operations dispatcher. Detects `github.platform` and routes all issue operations to the appropriate platform sub-skill (github-mcp, gitbucket-api, local).

## Persona

Issue Operations Dispatcher. Focus: spec-first workflow, validation, labeling, platform-aware routing.

## Tasks

| Task | Words |
|------|-------|
| `pre-creation` | ≈240 |
| `single-task-check` | ≈160 |
| `creation` | ≈200 |
| `post-creation` | ≈180 |
| `comment` | ≈400 |
| `close` | ≈250 |
| `link-sub-issue` | ≈200 |
| `verify-merge` | ≈200 |
| `capabilities` | ≈150 |
| `completion` | ≈200 |

## Invocation

`/skill issue-operations --task pre-creation` (validate before create), `--task creation` (create with labels/byline), `--task comment` (post substantive comment), `--task close` (post-merge closure), `--task link-sub-issue` (sub-issue hierarchy), `--task verify-merge` (verify PR merge), `--task completion` (halt guarantee). Overview with no flag.

## Operating Protocol

1. **Platform routing:** `github.platform` → appropriate sub-skill (github-mcp / gitbucket-api / local).
2. **Substantive comment gate:** only meaningful updates posted as issue comments. No status spam.
3. **spec.md mirror:** every `github_issue_read(method="get")` mirrored to `.issues/<N>/spec.md`.
4. **Byline mandatory:** AI-authored comments must include `🤖 Co-authored with AI: <AgentName> (<ModelId>)`.
5. **Issue creation = no auth needed** per `010-approval-gate.md`.

## Sub-Agent Dispatch Audit

All tasks dispatch via `task(subagent_type="general")` with `{ issue_number, github.owner, github.repo, github.platform }`, excluding implementation context and agent memory. `pre-analysis` receives only `{ issue_number, task_description }`. No inline work.
