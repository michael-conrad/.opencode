# skill-creator — deck governance

**Every deck edit passes this gate first.** The deck mutates through process,
not through casual edits — the historical record shows ~27,700 ungoverned
edits produced the doom loop this deck replaced.

## Admission gate — a new rule/skill/artifact enters only with ALL of:

1. **Observed failure** — a named incident or measured pattern, with evidence
   (session record, issue, database finding). No hypothetical failures.
2. **Consumer** — what reads or executes it, and when.
3. **Mechanism or trigger** — a skill-description trigger or a
   fact-decidable enforcement point.
4. **Predicate classification** — fact-decidable (scripts allowed: file
   exists, token in diff, tests pass) vs intent-decidable (scripts FORBIDDEN —
   judgment decides). Static checks on intent are the deck's founding defect.
5. **Domain match** — a protocol or paper adopted from another domain requires
   evidence in THIS domain (the DiMo lesson).
6. **Root-agnostic** — zero root-repo names or absolute paths; per-root facts
   arrive via session-init.
7. **What it replaces** — an admission that adds without retiring grows the
   deck; name the displaced content or justify the net-zero.
8. **Always-loaded surface discipline** — content enters `floor.md` or any
   always-injected file only if it must be visible **before any card
   dispatch** (definitions the proceed-or-halt decision depends on). Worked
   examples, stage mandates, and card-scoped directives are card-level; each
   slip fattens every session, and the slips add up.

## Developer-instruction carve-out

A **developer-directed** deck edit — one the developer explicitly requested in
the session — carries its own observed-failure evidence and authorization; the
gate governs agent-proposed deck content, not instruction execution. The gate's
standards still bind the *content* of what is written (frontmatter, predicate
classification, root-agnostic discipline hold), but the proposal-time evidence
hunt does not re-run at instruction-execution time: never perform archaeology
to manufacture evidence for an edit the developer just directed, and never
halt for direction the instruction already carries.

## Card standards

- Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `license`; provenance line.
- **Descriptions are the router**: state what the skill does AND when to load
  it, at both abstraction levels (domain framing + implementation framing —
  "before any code that contacts GitHub" catches what "GitHub operations"
  misses), deliberately pushy (agents undertrigger). **No user-phrase
  matching anywhere** — the floor's vocabulary table defines utterance
  meanings; descriptions match agent intent.
- Bodies stay lean; details go one level deep in `references/`.
- No TDTs, no dispatch-gate boilerplate, no artifact chains, no numeric size
  targets.

## Retirement gate

Content with lost provenance (no consumer/trigger), a declining usage trend
across deployments, or structural obsolescence is retired. Absence in a live
database is NOT evidence — retention vacuums delete history; verdicts use
deep history. Resurrection via git history is cheap; hoarding is not.

## Vendor-card boundary

Vendor-generated cards (e.g. `hf skills add`) are referenced and regenerated
by their owning tool — never hand-edited. Card origins: deck-authored
(governed) / vendor-generated / project-local.
