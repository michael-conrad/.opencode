# Skill Creator

## Overview

Creating skills IS TDD applied to process documentation. Write tests, watch them fail, write the skill, watch tests pass, refactor.

Also manages duplicate text blocks across skills (formerly `fragment-manager` skill): CRUD on master files (`.opencode/.guidelines/`), sync masters to copies, drift detection.

## Tasks

| Task | Words |
|------|-------|
| `init` | ≈200 |
| `package` | ≈150 |
| `validate` | ≈100 |
| `fragment-management` | ≈300 |

## Invocation

`skill({name: "skill-creator"})` — call the skill, then call via task():

| Task | Call via task() |
|------|----------|
| `init` | `task(..., prompt: "execute init task from skill-creator")` |
| `package` | `task(..., prompt: "execute package task from skill-creator")` |
| `validate` | `task(..., prompt: "execute validate task from skill-creator")` |
| `fragment-management` | `task(..., prompt: "execute fragment-management task from skill-creator")` |

**CLI equivalent (for human TUI use):** `/skill skill-creator --task <task>`

## Operating Protocol

1. **Iron Law:** no skill creation/update without failing test first (RED phase). Document baseline failure.
2. **No hardcoded identity values:** use `<AgentName>`, `<ModelId>`, `<github.owner>`, `<github.repo>`, `<dev.name>`, `<dev.email>` placeholders.
3. **Worktree awareness mandatory** for skills with git/file operations.
4. **Submodule path awareness:** All tools/scripts in generated skills MUST account for workdir being inside a submodule. Paths MUST NOT compose `.opencode/.opencode/` nesting. See `000-critical-rules.md` §Creating .opencode/.opencode/ Nested Directories and `060-tool-usage.md` §2 Workdir-Aware Path Composition.
5. **Enforcement test step mandatory** after creation/update — add behavioral test scenarios.
6. **Verification-enforcement gate** before skill generation.
7. **Required frontmatter:** name, description, type, license, provenance, compatibility.
8. **Session-init variable alignment:** use canonical dotted-name format.
9. **Fragment discipline:** master copy is single source of truth — never edit copies directly. Registry at `.opencode/.guidelines/registry.yaml`.

## Sub-Agent Routing

`init` runs with `{ skill_name, output_dir, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`. `package` with `{ skill_folder, output_dir, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`. `validate` with `{ skill_folders, validation_scope, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`. `fragment-management` with `{ fragment_name, destination_paths, operation, worktree.path, github.owner, github.repo }`. Exclusions: implementation context, agent memory. When routing auditor sub-agents, include `audit_phase` in task context per SC-6. `pre-analysis` receives only `{ issue_number, task_description, github.owner, github.repo }`. No inline work.
