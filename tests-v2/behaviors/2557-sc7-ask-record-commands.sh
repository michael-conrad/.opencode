# Behavioral test: 2557-sc7-ask-record-commands
# See .opencode/tests-v2/AGENTS.md for the test harness specification and paradigm.
# This script is an artifact-only generator — it does NOT evaluate model output.
#
# .opencode#2557 SC-7: when the repo's declared canonical build/test command
# cannot be discovered from its build manifest, the agent asks the developer
# and records the confirmed command in the repository's build manifest rather
# than guessing.
#
# TWO-TURN DESIGN (§10.7 cross-invocation resumption):
#   Turn 1 (behavior_run, fresh home): the repo's AGENTS.md declares no
#     build/test commands — the agent must ask rather than guess.
#   Turn 2 (with-test-home --resume-home + `run --continue`, same home): the
#     developer's confirmation arrives; the agent records the confirmed
#     command in the build manifest and runs it.
#   The home's session DB accumulates BOTH turns' events; the final
#   session.yaml export covers the full exchange (the ask, the confirmation,
#   and the recorded result). The turn-2 resume intentionally bypasses
#   behavior_run's fresh-session isolation assert (R-22) — resumption is the
#   sanctioned multi-turn path (§10.7); the shared-DB export is the evidence.
#
# PROMPT CONSTRUCTION: real-domain task — run the suite; the developer's
# confirmation is a real reply, not an embedded hint. Not an interview question.
#
# FIXTURE: fixtures/setup/2557-sc7-ask-record-commands.sh creates a Python
# project whose AGENTS.md has NO commands section.
