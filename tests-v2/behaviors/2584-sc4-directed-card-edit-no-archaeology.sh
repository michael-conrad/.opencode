# This script is an artifact-only generator — it does NOT evaluate model output.
#
# .opencode#2584 SC-4: an agent given a developer-directed single-rule card edit
# performs the edit without admission archaeology and without halting for
# direction (developer-instruction carve-out in the skill-creator admission
# gate). Clean-room evaluation over session.yaml (orchestrator side).
#
# .opencode#2657 SC-12 (second criterion, beside the one above): the same
# directed edit completes without the full path's machinery — no issue filed,
# no spec document, no validation dispatch. Clean-room evaluation over
# session.yaml (orchestrator side).

SCENARIO_TIER="2"
# Goal condition (tests-v2 AGENTS.md §14): the monitor's classifier judges the run
# against this declared condition, and the SC-8 determination gate lets a run that
# hits the per-turn output cap resume. The goal artifact is the card the developer
# directed the edit into, and the pattern is the rule the edit adds.
BEHAVIOR_EXPECTED_ARTIFACT=".opencode/skills/correspondence/SKILL.md"
# The completion pattern is the rule NUMBER the prompt names, not the word
# "byline" — rule 5 already carries "byline", so a pattern on that word is
# satisfied before the run starts, and the monitor then judges the run
# against a condition already met (observed 2026-10-24, .opencode#2657). The
# card has rules 1-5 and no other "6." before the run, so the pattern
# discriminates.
